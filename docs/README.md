This is a coding exercise that I had to solve for a job interview for the Fullstack Engineer position.

## The interviewer's task

## About project

In the job description was written about PHP and Vanilla JS, for this reason I used only JavaScript to solve the exercise, and for the creation of the answer file I used PHP as a backend. The output_data.json file will be created in the project folder.

I ignored the comments, I hope my code is clear. In addition to the arrows and the submit button, I also added some progress bar dots. The question can be reached by clicking on the dot.

If the survey has only one question, the next and prev buttons disappear and only the submit button is visible (I was too lazy to hide the dot bar for this case).

You will need a PHP environment to run the project. For example XAMPP.
